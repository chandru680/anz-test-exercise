Under the features folder we have the feature file stored which contains the test scenarios.
The page factory folder contains all the Web elements  in  a structured format which we are using in our test.
Step definitions containing the test steps matching to the scenarios from the feature file.
The test runner is heart of the project. We can either run the test by running the TestRunner or running the testing.xml file
